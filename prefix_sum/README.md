### PREFIX SUM ###

```A prefix sum array, also known as a cumulative sum array, is a derived array that stores the cumulative sum of elements in a given array. Each element in the prefix sum array represents the sum of all elements up to that index in the original array. It acts as a precursor to answering queries related to cumulative sums, allowing for fast and efficient computations. It also reduces time complexity giving us a way out of TLE. ```

```python
def construct_prefix_sum_array(arr):
  n = len(arr)
  prefix_sum = [0] * n
  prefix_sum[0] = arr[0]
  for i in range(1, n):
  prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i â€” 1] + arr[i]
  return prefix_sum
```
